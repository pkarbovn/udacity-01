In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Model 1** : max_depth = 1. Maximum depth of the model is 1. Score for training set, as more points are added, start high but decrees. Score for the testing curve, as more points are added, start low but increases. As more points are added, training curve and testing curve are converging to around 50 percent score.  Convergence of testing and training scores occurring when size of the training set is 200 or more. Adding more points to training set seems to have no effect on convergence, the training and test score will stabilize when set reached 200 points, and stay relatively constant fluctuating around same values.\n",

Score for the testing curve, as more points are added, start low but rapidly increases. As more points are added, training curve and testing curve are converging. Upon convergence there is a sizable gap between training and testing score. Convergence of testing and training scores occurring when size of the training set is 200 or more. Adding more points to training set seems to have no effect on convergence, the training and test score will stabilize when set reached 200 points, and stay relatively constant fluctuating around same values.\n",

Score for the testing curve, as more points are added, start low but rapidly increases. As more points are added, training curve and testing curve are converging. Upon convergence there is a sizable gap between training and testing score. Convergence of testing and training scores occurring when size of the training set is 150 or more.

    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 1 is *underfitting*, Model 2 is **good**, Model 3 and Model 4 is *overfitting*. Overfitting increases with depth of the model:  Model 4 show **worse performance** than Model 3."

    "### Complexity Curves\n",
    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

This algorithm have following hyperparameters : kernel which can be liner or polynomial and gamma hyperparameter, which is a R-value. The matrix in this case (grid) will be two dimensional. One axis will have only two values: kernel liner or polynomial.  Second axis will be set of gamma values. Because R-values form an infinite set we want to limit this by some rule. Rule for example can be : R values must be positive, located in [0.1 to 100] interval and increase exponentially. \n",

    "\n",
    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that. You can refer to the [docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation) for your answer."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- K-fold cross-validation training technique is a training technique which maximizes amount of data in training set. Non K-fold validation training technique will require a three set of data: training set, validation set and test set. Because of this, amount of data available for training is reduced. We would like to maximize our training set and use (if possible) all available data. K-fold cross-validation training technique allow us to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In K-fold cross-validation training k means number of buckets. Data from full set is split in k-buckets, before each split data is randomly reshuffled (data assumed to be IID: Independent and Identically Distributed). For each training iteration of model k-1 buckets are used as training set and 1 (one) bucket is used as validation set. Model is trained k times, score for training is calculated as average for all the training iterations, score for testing is calculated as average for all the testing iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- K-fold cross validation helps grid search by removing the main drawbacks of grid search when search are hinged upon using a particular subset of data for training or testing. When search are  hinged upon using a particular subset of data for training or testing, this particular set, by accident, can produce skewed results. This result may not reflect the best set of hyperparameters which will optimize our model. Using not optimal set of hyperparameters will result in obtaining not the best possible predictions from our model."

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
