    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

The matrix in this case (grid) will be two dimensional. One axis will have values for kernel type: liner or polynomial. Second axis will be a set of gamma values. Because R-values create an infinite set, we want to limit this set. Limiting rule can be : R-values must be positive, located in [0.1, 100] interval and increase exponentially.\n",

Non K-fold validation training technique will require a three set of data: training set, validation set and test set. Have these set fixed, we removing data from training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In K-fold cross-validation we are using **all available data** for training and testing. Data from full dataset is split in **k-buckets**. For each **training** iteration of model, **k-1 buckets** are used as training set and **1 (one)** bucket is used as **test set**. Model is **trained k times**, score for training is calculated as average for all the training iterations, score for testing is calculated as average for all the testing.\n",

    "- A particular subset of data, when used for training or testing, can produce **skewed** results. This result may **not reflect** the best set of hyperparameters which will optimize our model.

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",

    "- **Client 3's** selling price: `$932,000.00`\n",

    "Prices seems to be reasonable given the values for the respective features. In Data Exploration section we obtained following statistics:\n",

    "- Minimum price: `$105,000.0`\n",
    "- Maximum price: `$1,024,800.0`\n",
    "- Mean price: `$454,342.94`\n",
    "- Median price `$438,900.0`\n",
    "- Standard deviation of prices: `$165,340.28`\n",

    "**Client 1** is middle class client (Our benchmark). Hist recommended selling price is `$403,000.00` which is close to the median price of  `$438,900.0`  what is **0.3** of standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client 3** has the best house, in the best public school neighborhood with the lowest poverty level. On top of this, his house is **1.6 times bigger** than that of Client 1. This alone will put his price at `$645,000.00`, plus premium of `$270,000.00` for best location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client 2** has the smallest house, in a neighborhood with a relatively high poverty rate and not the best public schools. This is our poor client. Using  middle class client as a benchmark, his house price based on size alone, will be around `$322,000.00`. There is `$84,000.00` penalty for bad neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does premium of `$270,000.00` and `$84,000.00` penalty is justifiable for best/worst location given the data and the earlier calculated descriptive statistics. It difficult to say. To be useful our statistic, I think, should be specific to the clients  neighborhoods, the general statistics we have, I think, is useless. Analogy here can be: we have a general statistic about cancer patients but trying to draw conclusion about specific type of the cancer :  there can be huge differences between leukemia, prostate and breast cancers development, treatments etc.\n"

    "An optimal model is not necessarily a robust model. Sometimes, a model is either too complex or too simple to sufficiently generalize to new data. Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable — i.e., the model is underfitted. \n",

    "**Hint:** Take a look at the range in prices as calculated in the code snippet above. Some questions to answering:\n",
    "- How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978? How important is inflation?\n",
    "- Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home? Do you think factors like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?\n",
    "- Is the model robust enough to make consistent predictions?\n",
    "- Would data collected in an urban city like Boston be applicable in a rural city?\n",
    "- Is it fair to judge the price of an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood?"

    "This model **should not be used** in real-world settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outdated data**. Model is based on data collected from 1978. This data is outdated and any house price prediction will reflect situation which existed around that period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inflation**. It is an important factor, however this is a **global factor**. It is not capturing locality which exist in this particular city, but reflect a global economic trend which is useful but is too general.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insufficient Features**. Features present in the data is insufficient to describe a home. Factors like quality of appliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool, **waterfront** etc. should be factored in. (Waterfront alone can fetch 50% premium)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model not robust**. Price sensitivity of around `$69,000.00` is not very usefull. It is a half of standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No applicable**. Data collected in an urban city like Boston will not be applicable in a **rural city**. I also think that data collected is similar size city would not be applicable as well. There is too many local variation between cities. The best approach will be to train model on local data, instead of trying to predict prices in Toronto using Boston model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Various factors**. Any house price prediction model should include **various factors**. But characteristics of the house neighbourhood is a huge and dominate factor. The **\"base\"** price of the house will be determined by neighbourhood. (Location! Location! Location!)"
